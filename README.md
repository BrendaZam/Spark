We are using the Wistia API to manage our content. All you have to do is pull out the last digits on the URL from your video. 

Ejample: https://setih.wistia.com/medias/pz88xvd5uk

**Markdown:** 

We also love markdown. So to create those lessons notes we are using github-markdown. And that also means that you can add emojis.
